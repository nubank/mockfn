# mockfn

[`mockfn`](https://github.com/pmatiello/mockfn) is a library supporting mockist
test-driven-development in Clojure. It is meant to be used alongside a regular
testing framework such as `clojure.test`.

## Framework-agonostic usage

In order to use `mockfn`, it's enough to require it in a test namespace.

```clj
(:require [mockfn.macros :as mfn]
          [mockfn.matchers :as matchers]
          ...)
```

This will bring `mockfn` features in scope for this namespace.

### Stubbing Function Calls

The `providing` macro replaces functions with mocks. These mocks return
preconfigured values when called with the expected arguments.

```clj
(testing "providing"
  (providing [(one-fn) :result]
    (is (= :result (one-fn)))))
```

As presented below, a mock (`one-fn`) can be configured with different returns
for different arguments.

```clj
(testing "providing - one function, different arguments"
  (providing [(one-fn :argument-1) :result-1
              (one-fn :argument-2) :result-2]
    (is (= :result-1 (one-fn :argument-1)))
    (is (= :result-2 (one-fn :argument-2)))))
```

It's also possible to configure multiple mocks, for multiple functions, at
once.

```clj
(testing "providing with more than one function"
  (providing [(one-fn :argument) :result-1
              (other-fn :argument) :result-2]
    (is (= :result-1 (one-fn :argument)))
    (is (= :result-2 (other-fn :argument))))))
```

#### `calling`

If you would like to call the value instead of returning it, use `mockfn.macros/calling`:

```clj
(testing "providing - calling mocked value as a function"
  (providing [(one-fn) (calling #(throw (ex-info "one-fn failed" {:args 'none})))]
    (is (thrown? ExceptionInfo (one-fn)))))
```

#### `fall-through`

When mocking a function, it is sometimes useful to allow calls with specific
arguments to fall through to their original implementation:

```clj
(testing "providing - using fall-through to default to original function"
  (providing [(one-fn :argument-1) mockfn.macros/fall-through
              (one-fn :argument-2) :result-2]
    (is (thrown? ExceptionInfo (one-fn)))))
```

#### Private functions

Private functions can be mocked by following Clojure's convention of referring
them by their var, prefixing them with `#'`.

```clj
(testing "providing - private function"
  (providing [(#'private-fn) :result]
    (is (= :result (#'private-fn)))))
```

### Verifying Interactions

The `verifying` macro works similarly, but also defines an expectation for the
number of times a call should be performed during the test. A test will fail if
this expectation is not met.

```clj
(testing "verifying"
  (verifying [(one-fn :argument) :result (exactly 1)]
    (is (= :result (one-fn :argument)))))
```

Notice that the expected number of calls is defined with a
[matcher](#built-in-matchers).

### Argument Matchers

Mocks can be configured to return a specific value for a range of different
arguments through [matchers](#built-in-matchers).

```clj
(testing "argument matchers"
  (providing [(one-fn (at-least 10) (at-most 20)) 15]
    (is (= 15 (one-fn 12 18))))))
```

## Syntax sugar for clojure.test

Support for [clojure.test](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html)
is provided in the `mockfn.clj-test` namespace.

```clj
(:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
          [mockfn.clj-test :as mfn]
          [mockfn.matchers :as matchers]
          ...)
```

The `mockfn.clj-test/deftest` and `mockfn.clj-test/testing` macros replace
`clojure.test/deftest` and `clojure.test/testing` and support a flatter (as in
not nested) mocking style using `mockfn.clj-test/providing` and
`mockfn.clj-test/verifying`:

```clj
(mfn/deftest deftest-with-builtin-mocking
  (is (= :one-fn (one-fn)))
  (mfn/providing
    (one-fn) :one-fn)

  (mfn/testing "testing with built-in-mocking"
    (is (= :one-fn (one-fn)))
    (is (= :other-fn (other-fn)))
    (mfn/verifying
      (other-fn) :other-fn (exactly 1))))
```

Notice that in order to leverage the built-in support for mocking in these
macros, it's necessary to use the `providing` and `verifying` versions provided
at the `mockfn.clj-test` namespace.

## Built-in Matchers

The following matchers are included in `mockfn`:

### exactly

```clj
(exactly expected)
```

Matches if actual value is equal to the expected value.

### at-least

```clj
(at-least expected)
```

Matches if actual value is greater or equal than the expected value.

### at-most

```clj
(at-most expected)
```

Matches if actual value is less or equal than the expected value.

### any

```clj
(any)
```

Always matches.


### a

```clj
(a expected)
```

Matches if actual value is an instance of the expected type.

### pred

```clj
(pred odd?)
```

Matches when the predicate applied to the actual value results in a truthy value.

Functions will automatically be interpreted as `pred` matchers, and hence don't
need to explicitly be wrapped in the `pred` matcher.

## External Matchers

Functions placed in the argument position of mocks will be treated as `pred`
matchers by default. Thus, one can make use of external predicate functions to
perform matching.

### matcher-combinators

[`matcher-combinators`](https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators) is a
library for comparing nested datastructures and pretty printing mismatch diffs.
It can be used to specify `mockfn` argument matching behavior, for example:

```clj
(require '[matcher-combinators.standalone :refer [match?]]
         '[matcher-combinators.matchers :as m])

(testing "matcher-combinator example"
  (providing [(one-fn (match? (m/in-any-order [1 3 2]))) :result-unordered]
    (is (= :result-unordered (one-fn [3 2 1])))))
```

## Quirks and Limitations

While `providing` and `verifying` calls can be nested, all required stubs and
expectations for a single mock must be defined in the same call. Mocking a
function in a inner `providing` or `verifying` call will override any
definitions made in the outer scope for the tests being run in the inner scope.

```clj
(testing "nested mocks"
  (providing [(one-fn :argument-1) :result-1]
    (providing [(one-fn :argument-2) :result-2
                (other-fn :argument-3) :result-3]
      (is (thrown? ExceptionInfo (one-fn :argument-1)))
      (is (= :result-2 (one-fn :argument-2)))
      (is (= :result-3 (other-fn :argument-3))))
    (is (= :result-1 (one-fn :argument-1))))))
```
